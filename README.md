Rad AI fork of dateinfer. Repo is useful for getting datetime format strings from raw text but the original author disappeared and won't merge the PR's required to make it work on python3. This is a working replica of one of the PR's

Python library to infer date format from examples

-------------------------------------------------

Imagine that you are given a large collection of documents and, as part of the extraction process, extract date
 information and store it in a normalized format. If the documents follow a single schema, the ideal approach
 is to craft a date parsing string for the schema. However, if the documents follow different schemas or if the
 contents are noisy (e.g. date fields were hand-populated), the development can become onerous.

This library makes a "best guess" on the proper date parsing string (`datetime.strptime`) based on examples in
the file.

<a name="installation"></a>Installation
---------------------------------------

The simplest way to install the library is:

````
$ pip install dateinfer
````

<a name="usage"></a>Usage
-------------------------

````Python
>>> import dateinfer
>>> dateinfer.infer(['Mon Jan 13 09:52:52 MST 2014', 'Tue Jan 21 15:30:00 EST 2014'])
'%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y'
>>>
````

Give `dateinfer.infer` a list of example date strings. `infer` returns a `datetime.strftime`/`strptime`-compliant
date format string for its "best guess" of a format string that will correctly parse the majority of the examples.
